Private data brokers, which compile everything from our sex habits to our
 license plate license location, are a growing cause of concern.

\begin_layout Quote
Some brokers categorize consumers as "Getting By," "Compulsive Online Gamblers"
 and "Zero Mobility" and advertise the lists as ideal leads for banks, credit-ca
rd issuers and payday and subprime lenders, according to a review of data
 brokers' websites.
 One company offers lists of "Underbanked Prime Prospects" broken down by
 race.
 Others include "Kaching! Let it Ride Compulsive Online Gamblers" and "Speedy
 Dinero," described as Hispanics in need of fast cash receptive to subprime
 credit offers.

 NOTE: This data is generated by using the ISO 3166 economy code information
 provided in the allocation and assignment statistics reports as generated
 by the Regional Internet Registries.
 This code reflects the economy in which the entity to whom the allocation
 or assignment was made is located, but does not necessarily reflect the
 scope of use of deployment of the associated resource.
 Many Internet service networks have international components, and their
 numbering resources are often deployed across multiple economies.
 For this reason the report presented here does not accurately reflect the
 actual number resource distributions across these economies.
