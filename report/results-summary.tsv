Swedish top/curated	Random .se	Other findings
{
Over 90\% of most categories' domains rely on external resources -- considered trackers (\ref{sec:Internal-versus-external})
}	{
Uses more external resources than .dk, but less than .com and .net (\ref{sec:Internal-versus-external})
}	{
There are as many external resources, meaning as much tracking, on secure as insecure top domains (figure \ref{fig:Cumulative-distribution-ratio-internal-resources})
}
{
Only 13 of 290 municipalities have fully secure websites; no Swedish media sites are completely secure (\ref{sec:Insecure-versus-secure-resources})

25\% of Swedish municipalities responding to secure requests load 90\% of their resources securely -- it's close, but still considered insecure (figure \ref{fig:Cumulative-distribution-ratio-secure-resources})

Only 3\% respond to secure requests, in line with .dk and .net, while .com has 5-6\% response rate (\ref{sec:Failed-versus-non-failed})

{
Financial instititions redirect from secure \emph{to insecure} sites for 60\% of responding domains (\ref{sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects})
}	{
Many random domains use only external resources due to redirects away from the origin domain (\ref{sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects})
}	{
50\% of top sites always redirect to the www subdomain, 13\% always redirect to their primary domain (\ref{sec:HTTP,-HTTPS-and-redirects})
}

XXX
}	{
40\% of random .se domains have no known trackers -- 60\% do (figure \ref{fig:Organizations-per-domain})
}	{
A few global top domains load more than 75 known trackers on their front page alone (\ref{sub:Domain-and-organization})
