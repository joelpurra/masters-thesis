<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-14' />
How many companies are tracking you online, and how much information does the average Swede leak while using popular .se websites? Many, and a lot - more than you think. Large organizations <div class="note_greyedout"><div class="note_greyedout_inner"><a id='magicparlabel-18' />
like A, B and C</div></div> are able to connect the dots you leave behind during everyday usage, and construct a persona that reflects you from their perspective. Have you told your family, friends or colleagues about your gambling addiction, your sex toy purchases or your alcoholism? <div class="note_greyedout"><div class="note_greyedout_inner"><a id='magicparlabel-22' />
Replace with different scary personal information.</div></div> Even if you didn't tell anyone your deepest secrets, these companies might conclude that they can put labels on you by looking at everything you do online. And now they are selling it as hard facts behind the scenes.</div>
<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-23' />
While browsing the web users are both actively and passively being tracked by multiple companies, for the purpose of building a persona for targeted advertising. Sometimes the data collection is visible, as in social network sites and questionnaires, but it's most common in the form of different kinds of external resources which may or may not serve a purpose other than keeping track of your every click. Tracking code is installed on web pages that have adverts as well as those that do not - the spread and reach of tracking across web pages and domains of different kinds increases the quality of the user data collected and inferred, making it more valuable for advertising purposes. With the extent of the use of trackers and other external resources largely unknown and ever evolving, what is already known raises privacy concerns - data considered personal leak without the user's knowledge or explicit permission and end up in privately owned databases for further distribution. Data collection is the new wild west, and you are the new cattle. <div class="note_greyedout"><div class="note_greyedout_inner"><a id='magicparlabel-27' />
Or Klondike and gold?</div></div></div>
<div class="abstract_item"><a id='magicparlabel-28' />
To show the overlap between different sites, front pages of Swedish top sites were downloaded and their resources counted and grouped. In this thesis I show the use of resources internal versus external to the entry domain, which the most common confirmed trackers are, what spread they have and how much the average Swedish internet user can expect to be tracked by visiting some of the most import and popular sites in Sweden.</div>

Background and context</h2>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-37' />
Part of .SE’s research efforts include continuously analyzing internet infrastructure and usage in Sweden. Yearly reports convey the status of, for example, <em>Swedes and the internet</em> and <em>.se health status</em>[<a href='#LyXCite-Lowinder_2012_healthstatus'>12</a>] to the public, both in Swedish<div class="foot"><span class="foot_label">2</span><div class="foot_inner"><div class="plain_layout"><a id='magicparlabel-41' />

The report <em>.se health status</em> is based on data collected from around 900 .se domain names deemed of importance to the Swedish society as a whole, as well as random selection of 1% of the registered .se domain names. The research is focused on statistics about usage and security in DNS, IP, web and e-mail; the target audience is IT strategists, executives and directors. Data is analyzed and summarized by Anne-Marie Eklund Löwinder, a world-renown DNS and security expert<div class="foot"><span class="foot_label">5</span><div class="foot_inner"><div class="plain_layout"><a id='magicparlabel-54' />

<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-61' />
Background</h3>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-62' />
In everyday web browsing, browsers routinely access a lot of material from other domains or services than the one visited.[<a href='#LyXCite-Feldmann_2004_MEI_1028788_1028833'>4</a>] These external resources vary from content that the user explicitly want to obtain, to implicitly loaded third party services, ads, and non-visible resources with the sole purpose of collecting user data and statistical material.[<a href='#LyXCite-Krishnamurthy_2006_CMC_1135777_1135829'>8</a>] All are downloaded on behalf of the user with no or few limitations, and oftentimes without the user's need, understanding and explicit consent. These external resources can all be seen as browsing habit trackers, whose knowledge and power increase with any additional visits to other domains or services loading the same resources.[<a href='#LyXCite-Malandrino_2013_PAI_2517840_2517868'>13</a>]</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-63' />
While online privacy has been in the spotlight due to recently uncovered mass surveillance operations, the focus has been on national government intelligence agencies collecting information around the globe. They have been able to intercept traffic data and metadata by, among several techniques, covertly hooking into the internet infrastructure. In contrast, external resources are approved by and actively installed by site and service owners, and presented openly to users with basic technical skills and tools. Because these external resources are used on behalf of the service, they are also loaded when end-to-end encryption with HTTPS is enabled for enhanced privacy and security. This encryption gives these private trackers more information than possible with large-scale passive traffic interception, even when there is a security nullifying mixture of encrypted and unencrypted connections.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-64' />
Depending on what activities a user performs online, different things can be inferred by trackers on sites where they are installed. For example, a tracker on a news site can draw conclusions about interests from content a user reads (or choses <em>not</em> to) by tagging articles with refined keywords and creating an interest graph.[<a href='#LyXCite-Kumar_2013_GBT_2522548_2523129'>9</a>] The range of taggable interests of course depend on the content of the news site. Private and sensitive information leaked to third party sites during typical interaction with some of the most popular sites in the world include personal identification (full name, date of birth, email, ip address, geolocation) and sensitive information (sexual orientation, religious beliefs, health issues).[<a href='#LyXCite-Malandrino_2013_PAI_2517840_2517868'>13</a>] Social buttons, allowing users to share links with a simple click, are tracking users whether they are registered, logged in or not.[<a href='#LyXCite-Roosendaal_2010_likethis'>14</a>] They are especially powerful when the user is registered and logged in, combining the full self-provided details of the user with their browsing habits.[<a href='#LyXCite-Kontaxis_2012_PSP_2362793_2362823'>6</a>]</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-65' />
Publishers reserve areas of their web pages for displaying different kinds and sizes of advertisements alongside content. Ads chosen for the site may be aligned with the content but it is more valuable the more is known about the visitors. Combining and aggregating information from past visitors means that more information can be assumed about future visitors, on a statistical basis, which will define the general audience of the site. To generate even more revenue per displayed ad, individual users are <em>targeted</em> with personalized ads depending on their specific personal data and browsing history.[<a href='#LyXCite-Gill_2013_BPF_2504730_2504768'>5</a>] <div class="note_greyedout"><div class="note_greyedout_inner"><a id='magicparlabel-69' />
What kind of data can be collected by trackers, and how can they be aggregated both per person and per group of people?</div></div></div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-70' />
<div class="note_greyedout"><div class="note_greyedout_inner"><a id='magicparlabel-74' />
How much does the average user know about external resources being trackers?</div></div></div>
<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-75' />
Expected results</h3>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-76' />
Previous research show that ads were used on 58% of internet's 500 most popular sites.[<a href='#LyXCite-Krishnamurthy_2006_CMC_1135777_1135829'>8</a>] Google Analytics usage among Swedish top domains was 57% in 2011 and 62% 2012.[<a href='#LyXCite-Lowinder_2011_healthstatus'>11</a>, <a href='#LyXCite-Lowinder_2012_healthstatus'>12</a>] The assumption is that the number of external resources is at least as big, as they include both ads and Google Analytics. Technical reasons include cloud services hosting sites and services, content delivery networks becoming commonplace[<a href='#LyXCite-Krishnamurthy_2000_AFI_347319_346248'>7</a>, <a href='#LyXCite-Krishnamurthy_2006_CMC_1135777_1135829'>8</a>] for scalable speed improvements and external service providers increasing their quality. <div class="note_greyedout"><div class="note_greyedout_inner"><a id='magicparlabel-80' />
Add non-technical reasons.</div></div></div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-81' />
Sites served over HTTPS are expected to use as many external resources as HTTP, even though some of these external resources might not be served over HTTPS as well.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-82' />
News sites are expected to allow more trackers than other categories, as their income model include third party advertisements.[<a href='#LyXCite-Krishnamurthy_2006_CMC_1135777_1135829'>8</a>] Commercial sites are expected to have more trackers than government sites.</div>
<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-83' />
Direction and scope</h3>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-84' />
Emphasis for the thesis will be on technical analysis, producing aggregate numbers regarding domains and external resources. Social aspects and privacy concerns are considered out of scope.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-85' />
The thesis will primarily be written from a Swedish perspective. This is in part because .SE has access to the full list of Swedish .se domains, and part because of their previous work with the <em>.se health status</em> reports. Focus is to analyze .se domains in the reports, as they have already been deemed important and results can be incorporated in future reports. The main non-technical grouping is also based on the same reports; government, media, banks, larger websites, etcetera.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-86' />
One assumption is that all external resources can act as trackers, collecting data and tracking users across domains using for example the <code class="flex_code">Referer</code> HTTP header[<a href='#LyXCite-Krishnamurthy_2006_CMC_1135777_1135829'>8</a>]. While there are lists of known trackers, used by browser privacy tools, they are not 100% effective.[<a href='#LyXCite-Malandrino_2013_PAI_2517840_2517868'>13</a>, <a href='#LyXCite-Krishnamurthy_2006_CMC_1135777_1135829'>8</a>] The lists will instead optionally be used to emphasize those external resources as <em>confirmed</em> trackers.</div>
<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-91' />
Questions</h3>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-92' />
With domain and resource data in place, it will be aggregated to answer the following questions.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-93' />
<div class="note_greyedout"><div class="note_greyedout_inner"><a id='magicparlabel-97' />

Approach</h2>

<blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote_item"><a id='magicparlabel-132' />
The approach is a preliminary description of how the problem will be solved. This section shall also include a description of a method to evaluate that the problem is solved in a satisfactory way.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-133' />
Based on a list of domains, external resources are listed by downloading of the front page of each domain, and analyzing its HTML content. The URLs of external resources will be extracted, and associated with the domain they were loaded from.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-134' />
All external resources get some of the relevant data upon each request, even for static resources with no capabilities to dynamically survey the user's browser. While cookies used for tracking have been a concern for many, they are not necessary in order to identify most users upon return, even uniquely on a global level.[<a href='#LyXCite-Eckersley2009unique'>3</a>] Cookies will not be considered to be an indicator of tracking, as it can be assumed that a combination of other server and client side techniques can achieve the same goal as a tracking cookie.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-135' />
In order to facilitate repeatable and improvable analysis, tools will be developed to perform the collection and aggregation steps automatically. .SE already has a set of tools that run monthly; integration and interoperability will smooth the process and continuous usage.</div>
<h3 class="subsection_"><a id='magicparlabel-136' />
Potential problems</h3>

<ul class="itemize"><li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-137' />
Due to the dynamic nature of modern web pages, a static HTML analysis might not be enough. How can pages with dynamic script loading be analyzed?</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-138' />
Script aggregation and concatenation could give misleading numbers if only analyzed per URL. Is it possible to detect which known scripts are actually running?</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-139' />
Can Google Tag Manager<div class="foot"><span class="foot_label">7</span><div class="foot_inner"><div class="plain_layout"><a id='magicparlabel-143' />
<a href="http://www.google.com/tagmanager/">http://www.google.com/tagmanager/</a></div>
</div></div> scripts, which is script aggregation with asynchronous loading directed specifically to marketers, be analyzed to show each included service?</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-144' />
Can collected data served by different services differ depending on which tool is used to fetch the data?</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-145' />
Many of the external resources will be overlapping, and downloading them multiple times can be avoided by caching the file the first time in a run. Would keeping a local cache of recently requested URLs affect the results?</li>
<li class="itemize_item"><a id='magicparlabel-146' />
Automated downloading of webpages, especially downloading several in short succession, can be seen by site and service owners as disruptive by using system resources and skewing statistical data. Traversing different pages on a single website can also be detected by looking at for example navigational patterns.[<a href='#LyXCite-Tan_2002_DWR_593432_593521'>15</a>, <a href='#LyXCite-Lourenco_2006_CWC_1145581_1145634'>10</a>] By only downloading the domain root page and associated resources this tool might not fall into that category of detection. Will automated collection done for this report be detected and hindered?</li>
</ul>

Some research has been done surrounding ad networks, trackers and their spread on globally popular sites, as well as what kind of private data users can expect to more or less inadvertently share in the course of normal internet usage.

As for individuals, one of the most connected researchers in this field is Balachander Krishnamurthy<div class="foot"><span class="foot_label">12</span><div class="foot_inner"><div class="plain_layout"><a id='magicparlabel-169' />

</div></div>, who has worked with several groups looking at privacy in both online social networks (OSNs) and general websites.</div>

<div class="standard"><a id='magicparlabel-170' />
.SE themselves have written papers analyzing the technical state of services connected to .se domains. While they haven't concentrated on exploring the web services connected to these domains, they do offer some groundwork in terms of selecting and grouping Swedish domains as well as looking at Google Analytics coverage.[<a href='#LyXCite-Lowinder_2011_healthstatus'>11</a>, <a href='#LyXCite-Lowinder_2012_healthstatus'>12</a>] .SE's Internet Fund<div class="foot"><span class="foot_label">13</span><div class="foot_inner"><div class="plain_layout"><a id='magicparlabel-174' />

Media have made reports regarding mass surveillance, especially by the United States intelligence agency National Security Agency (NSA)<div class="foot"><span class="foot_label">14</span><div class="foot_inner"><div class="plain_layout"><a id='magicparlabel-179' />

</div></div>, but so far few papers seem to have been written. There are also reports on what data private companies are collecting, in part by their online efforts, and how they are packaging it for resale. While media reports aren't academic papers, they provide an up to date source of information needed in explaning parts of the thesis subject.</div>
